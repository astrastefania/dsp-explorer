Hi!

You are about to enter to the OpenMaker Digital Social Platform (OpenMaker DSP).

The platform will provide you with an easy-to-read dashboard displaying the most relevant innovation trends and networks, expressed in intuitive and graphical representations.
DSP runs a machine learning that harvests online relations of makers and manufacturers within the digital environments that they already use, by tracing, measuring and assessing relations and trends.

The platform will collect and analyse the personal data that are already public on your social networks, and will trace your publicly available online activities on these channels (Twitter, Google +, Linkedin, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, Instructables, Medium, Meet Up, GitHub, Slack).

Data will be collected and treated in Europe, by Bosphorus University, University of Zurich and IMT Lucca.
